# LinkPilot

The goal of LinkPilots is to develop a web application that makes it simple for users to collect, organize, and distribute their links.
<br>
Users frequently run into problems like forgetting to bookmark important websites or having trouble finding previously saved URLs.
<br>
Our main goal is to provide a user-friendly design that makes it easier to gather and organize connections, especially those that are pertinent to users' studies.
<br>
We also hope to offer a management tool that helps users properly cite their sources.
